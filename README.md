#  ML-Home-price-predictor-Bangalore

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices in Bangalore, India based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is trained using real estate data.

## Problem Statement

Real estate prices in Bangalore can vary greatly depending on location, amenities, and size. The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices, helping buyers and developers make informed decisions.

## Tech Stack

- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, GridSearchCV)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
  

## Features Used

- Location
- Total square feet
- Number of bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of bathrooms(bath)

##  Model Training

- Handled missing values and outliers
